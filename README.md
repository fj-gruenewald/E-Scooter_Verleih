# rentNscoot-application
Component based C# .Net core roller rental.

There are 2 components. A component for persistent data storage in a database and a component that contains the business logic. 

WPF is used as the frontend framework. The connection between frontend and backend is achieved with the mvvm architecture

Application:
  The application allows the user to rent a scooter for a certain period of time for a fee. The scooters as well as the places where they can be picked up are stored in a    database. The design basically consists of two areas: a table where you can select the scooters and a selection for the period of time you want to rent the scooter.
